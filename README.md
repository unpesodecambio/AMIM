# ðŸš¦ Urban Mobility Analysis â€“ AMIM Guadalajara

This repository compiles a series of **Python notebooks** created during my work at the **Metropolitan Infrastructure Agency for Mobility (AMIM)** in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area.

The notebooks include short analytical tasks developed for different departments, focused on **data-driven decision-making** in urban mobility.
